    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>Not so long ago, I participate in the social orientation course provided by the
      <a href="https://integratie-inburgering.be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopenet"> Agentschap Integratie en
        Inburgering</a> and found the content really useful Our teacher Heidi Thijs, gave us a lot of interesting
      resources and information.</p>
    <p>Talking with colleagues and friends about it, I realise that this information could be useful not only for the
      new comers in Belgium but for everybody living here, so I decided to make this small website to put this
      information together, organised.</p>
    <p>This is of course a work in progress and Iâ€™ll be adding more resources.</p>
    <p>If you have any question or suggestion about a resource that could be added to this lists please send me a
      message to <a href="mailto:info@belgium-paths.com">info@belgium-paths.com</a></p>
